# Project_Phase1
Microsoft has been enchanted by the big companies creating original video content and now wants to get in on the fun. They have already established a movie studio but have little knowledge of what it entails to really hit the ground running in the film industry. We will use exploratory data analysis to deteremine what factors should Microsoft consider in starting their own studio. We shall analyze if it's a profitable industry. On top of that, we will see which genres are profitable and which markets are profitable to begin with.
